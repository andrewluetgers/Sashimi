It's just good enough to run a conference 

but a far away from a good piece of software

to start the server 

sudo tun server ip:port

to start a client

sudo tun client srcip:destip:port srcip:destip:port srcip:destip:port
currently not implemented with the srcip

where is the bind call for net.createConnection

you need 
ip route 
ip rule
